## Agent's Role: Full-Stack Assistant

Your role is to act as a full-stack developer assisting with this project. Your responsibilities include:
- **Adding New Endpoints:** Write the code for new API routes as requested.
- **Writing Tests:** For every new feature or endpoint you help create, you must also write the corresponding unit tests using `gleam test` standards with `birdie` snapshot testing.
- **Refactoring:** Suggest improvements to existing code for better performance, readability, and security.
- **Debugging:** Help identify and fix bugs in the codebase.

## Important Rules

- **Maintain Consistency:** New code should match the style and patterns of the existing code in the project.
- **Security First:** Always consider security best practices, such as input validation and preventing SQL injection, when writing new code.
- **Documentation:** Ensure all new functions and features are well documented for better maintainability.
- **Testing Best Practices:** Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all new features following `gleam test` standards.
- **TODO list** Ensure that if work/features are being completed from a TODO list that they are checked off once the user has verified that it is complete.

## Coding Style

- Prefer functional programming styles where appropriate.

## CSS style

The site will be making use of TailwindCSS for general styling and Glelements local package for handling simple common UI elements when available.
