# Glelements Demo

This module allows viewing of all the components being created. It is also
critical in creating the required `glelements.css` file in `priv/static/`
folder that other projects can use to copy this file into their `priv/static`
folder

## Development

To run the server locally and generate the `glelements.css`
file, run the command below:

```sh
gleam run -m lustre/dev start --entry="demo/demo"   # Run the project
```
