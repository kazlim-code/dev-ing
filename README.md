# DevIng (Dev - Ingley) :)

## Description
This project is most likely going to end up being a front facing web
application where I can showcase my own person development work and learnings.

## Features
- Server written in Gleam using Wisp
- Client written in Gleam using Lustre for the front end
- CMS capable of simple blog functionality
- Potential to host/reference other projects and demos (most likely written in Gleam too)

## Technology stack
I'm planning on using Gleam as the backbone of this since I can make use of
strongly typed language that works on both the front/backend that compiles to
javascript. It is a fairly new language that I have been learning on and off
and being new to functional programming I'd like to continue using it to
improve my knowledge in this area.

- Gleam
  - Frontend
    - Lustre
  - Backend
    - Wisp?
- Database
  - Mysql?
    - What Gleam libraries can I use here?
- Hosting
  - Will GitHub pages suffice for now?

## Installation
- TBD (Step-by-step instructions on how to set up the project environment and
install dependencies. This is crucial for an AI to be able to run and test your
code.)
  - TODO: Include the specific commands to be run.

## Usage
TODO: Provide clear instructions on how to run the project and use its
features. Provide code snippets and examples of command-line arguments.

## TODO
What I will need to create to even get started displaying my work and blog posts:
- A simple website and server
- Some form of CMS
